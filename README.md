| ![Project Image](https://github.com/qiluchuan/Meijuan-Hu/blob/main/ML%20house%20price.png) | [**Machine Leaning for Real Estate Price Prediction**](https://github.com/qiluchuan/Machine-Learning-for-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction) | `Python` `Scikit-learn` `Jypyter Notebook` `KRR` `SVR` `DNN` |This project is to replicate and extend the findings from the article The Use of Machine Learning in Real Estate Research by implementing various machine learning and deep learning models. The machine learning techniques Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are performed. |
| ![Project Image](https://github.com/qiluchuan/Meijuan-Hu/blob/main/heatmap.png) | [**LA Crime Burglary Prediction Project**](https://github.com/qiluchuan/LA-Crime-Burglary-Prediction-Project) | `Python` `Scikit-learn``Heatmap` `Lasso` `Random Forest Tree` | Identify crime hotspots and developing prediction models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to forecast burglary incidents. Assist law enforcement, public safety, and urban planning stakeholders in making informed decisions to enhance crime prevention efforts and resource allocation. |
| ![Project Image]( https://github.com/qiluchuan/Meijuan-Hu/blob/main/flower%20classification.jpg) |[ **Deep Learning on Flower Classification**](https://github.com/qiluchuan/Deep-Learning-on-Flower-Classification-) |`Python` `Scikit-learn` `Jypyter Notebook` `CNN` `Transfer Learning` `VGG 19` | Machine learning and deep learning, among the most influential fields, have significantly enhanced various facets of our lives. CNN)stand out as a powerful category, particularly in addressing real-world challenges. Notably, pre-trained models such as Transfer Learning and VGG play a pivotal role in image classification applications. |
